    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style = 'text-indent: 2em;'>Over 40% of Americans are obese, and fast food has become deeply embedded in American culture. Approximately 37% of Americans consume fast food every day, averaging over 800 calories per meal—nearly half of the recommended daily caloric intake. Since the first White Castle opened in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, the industry has exploded into a global phenomenon, with chains like McDonald's now serving 26 million consumers daily in America alone. Despite these serious health consequences, consumers remain ill-equipped to understand what they are consuming and which items pose the greatest risks. This project analyzes over 5,000 menu items from more than 20 major U.S. fast-food chains to provide clear, data-driven insights into the nutritional landscape of fast food, empowering consumers to make informed dietary choices.</p>
    <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
    <p style = 'text-indent: 2em;'>
    This project utilizes the Fast Food Nutrition dataset from Kaggle, compiled by Ulrik Thyge Pedersen, which contains nutritional information for approximately 5,000 food items from over 20 major U.S. fast-food chains. The dataset includes comprehensive nutritional variables for each menu item: restaurant name, item name, calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugar, protein, and select vitamins and minerals (Vitamin A, Vitamin C, calcium). To ensure data quality and analytical accuracy, we performed several preprocessing steps including handling missing values for certain nutritional metrics, normalizing measurement units across different restaurant chains, removing duplicate entries, and categorizing food items into meaningful groups such as burgers, drinks, desserts, and sandwiches. This cleaned and structured dataset serves as the foundation for all subsequent analyses and visualizations, enabling us to identify nutritional patterns, compare restaurant offerings, and highlight both the healthiest and most problematic menu items available to consumers.

    This project draws upon peer-reviewed research to contextualize the nutritional analysis of fast food in America. Bauer et al.'s longitudinal study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine examines 14-year trends in nutritional quality across eight major U.S. fast-food chains, providing critical insight into how the industry has evolved over time. Bahadoran et al.'s comprehensive review in Health Promotion Perspectives explores the relationship between fast food consumption patterns and cardiometabolic disorders, highlighting the serious health implications of regular fast food intake. The primary dataset for this analysis comes from Ulrik Thyge Pedersen's "Fast Food Nutrition" compilation on Kaggle, which aggregates nutritional information from over 20 fast-food chains and serves as the foundation for our visualizations and findings. Together, these sources provide both the empirical data and scholarly context necessary to understand the nutritional landscape of American fast food and its impact on public health.
